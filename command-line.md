A command line terminal is to a computer, as commands are to a hypnotized human, if you know how to give the commands, the subject will do as instructed without quibble. The main difference being that with a computers command line terminal, the inputs are written.

mv    = move directory           = move a folder from a to be
mkdir = make directory           = make a new folder
rmdir = remove directory         = remove a folder
pwd   = print working directory  = display which folder i am currently in      
exit  = exit terminal            = cease command line terminal
ls    = list directory           = display contents of current folder
rm    = remove file              = remove a file
pushd = push directory           = create location restore point
popd  = pop directory            = go to previously saved restore point
sudo  = super user root          = "HA you thought you had a say in the matter"
11    = one higher
