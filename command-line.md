<p>A command line terminal is to a computer, as commands are to a hypnotized human, if you know how to give the commands, the subject will do as instructed without quibble. The main difference being that with a computers command line terminal, the inputs are written.</p>

<p>cd    = change directory         = move to a different folder</p>
<p>mv    = move directory           = move a folder from a to be</p>
<p>mkdir = make directory           = make a new folder</p>
<p>rmdir = remove directory         = remove a folder</p>
<p>pwd   = print working directory  = display which folder i am currently in</p>      
<p>exit  = exit terminal            = cease command line terminal</p>
<p>ls    = list directory           = display contents of current folder</p>
<p>rm    = remove file              = remove a file</p>
<p>pushd = push directory           = create location restore point</p>
<p>popd  = pop directory            = go to previously saved restore point</p>
<p>sudo  = super user root          = "HA you thought you had a say in the matter"</p>
<p>11    = one higher </p>
